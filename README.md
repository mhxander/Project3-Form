# Project3-Form
 
 This is my submission for Project 3-Interactive Form.
 
 I am going for Exceeds on this project.
 
 I made ALL required error messages respond in real-time.  The email submission changes the error message depending on if we have an empty field, as opposed to an incorrect submission.
 
 The color dropdown menu is gone until a t-shirt design is chosen, and then it only shows the required colors.  I also had some fun, and changed the background color of the color Div to represent the t-shirt color chosen.  I did include the code to hide all colors until a design is chosen(part of Meets), just to make sure I knew how to do it.  I did leave the "Select Theme" choice in there, in case some decided not to get a t-shirt.
 
 The validation stops the submit button from working unless all required fields pass validation.
